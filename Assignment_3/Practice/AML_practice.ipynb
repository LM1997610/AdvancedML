This dataset is distinct from the training and validation data, ensuring unbiased assessment. The test loop provides a reliable estimate of how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios, confirming that any improvements observed during training and validation are not due to overfitting or chance. It's a crucial step before deploying the model in practical applications."
